# TJHSST APCS A + Data Structures (2017 – 2018)
Extensive coverage of data structures, algorithms, complexity analysis, and software design through projects that applied the topics listed below. Contact me for more information!

•	Strings (cryptography, logging messages, translation, extraction, palindromes)

•	Recursion (NQueens, brute force, flood fill, permutations, evaluating expressions)

•	Sorts (implementation of selection, insertion, merge, quick, bubble, heap, and shell sorts; developed applet to simulate sort statistics through graphs and threads; big-O analysis) and searches (implementation of binary and linear searches)

•	Listnodes (LinkedLists, Doubly LinkedLists, 6-way implementation to reverse Lists, card shuffling)

•	Collections (ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, HashSets, TreeSets, HashMaps, TreeMaps, collection speeds and big-O analysis, Iterators, Comparable, Comparator)

•	Stacks, Queues, PQs (assembly/restaurant line/song management with VIPs; implementation of all three data structures using ArrayLists, arrays, LinkedLists, and ListNodes; prefix/infix/postfix traversals with parentheses and brackets considered)

•	Trees (self-balancing AVL trees, binary search trees, binary expression trees (BXT), spell check trees, Stern-Brocot Trees, tree PQs, merging, building full trees)

•	Hashing (linear probing; rehashing; chaining; efficient hailstone generation; textbook index maker and dictionaries; evaluation of polynomials, roots (Newton-Raphson Method), Taylor polynomials, integrals, and derivatives; letter analysis)

•	Heaps (HeapPQ with array, random/priority LinkedList, and min heap implementations and big-O analysis; complexity, extra space, stability, overhead analyses of merge, quick, and heap sort; PQ app for McDonalds; sort detective)

•	Huffman Compression Algorithm (coding and decoding; pixel processing)

•	Graphs (adjacency matrices, reachability matrices, directed/undirected/weighted graphs, Warshall’s Algorithm, Floyd’s Algorithm, edge lists, BFS/DFS search trees, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, brute force, greedy approach, dynamic programming, coin configurations, constrained travel cost/time problems, jug-filling problem)
